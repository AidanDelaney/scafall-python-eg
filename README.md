# Scafall Example

This project is an example scaffolding project.  It generates a trivial python application and demonstrates how to use `prompts.toml`.  If you would like to try it first install `scafall`:

```bash
$ go install github.com/AidanDelaney/scafall@latest
```

Then use this scaffolding to generate a new project:

```bash
$ scafall http://github.com/AidanDelaney/scafall-python-eg.git python-pi
```

You should be prompted for some values.  Follow the prompts and you will find the example project generated in a `project-pi` directory.
